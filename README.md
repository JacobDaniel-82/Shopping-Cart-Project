Welcome to the **Shopping Cart Application** repository! This project was developed as part of my internship at **iNeuron AI**. The application allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and view the total price. It’s built using modern frontend technologies to ensure a dynamic, responsive, and interactive user experience.
